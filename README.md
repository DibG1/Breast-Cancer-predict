# Malignancy-Detector

I have built a breast cancer detector using Neural Networks.
I used scikit-learn's Multilayer Perceptron Classifier to take the input data and output a binary result ultimately indicating presence/absence of malignancy
I trained the data using an open-source dataset and achieved high-accuracy.
This neural network takes several inputs such as the radius, texture, perimeter, area and smoothness of the tumor and determines if it is malignant or benign
